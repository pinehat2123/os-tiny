// remember, kernel mostly deals with sockets to manage io for processes and servers, IP packets and frames, reliable data delivery through checking higher level headers and where the stuff is coming from (?)
// try not to do too much in the kernel though. So prob just managing sockets and minimal security and safety with IP and MAC addresses
// merely to communicate with the network driver and application. Let the firmware (and drivers) and software do most of the stuff
